goal: get an interested programmer up to speed on high-level stuff about selenium and page object models.
goal specific to mozilla and browserid: make sure each of the parts underneath bidpom is explained, so people can contribute and understand what's up.
goal: get a really solid cookbook together.

existing resources to mention that support the annotated code samples:
- an overview of webdriver (Java centric but still straightforward)
    - here's the official 5 Minute Getting Started Guide: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/GettingStarted
- here is a good intro to page objects in very readable java: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects
    - here's the summary from that page, which is really good:
        The public methods represent the services that the page offers
        Try not to expose the internals of the page
        Generally don't make assertions
        Methods return other PageObjects
        Need not represent an entire page
        Different results for the same action are modelled as different methods 
- note that the RemoteWebDriver is two parts: client (the test code) and server (java server which lives on the box with the browser). 
    - more: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RemoteWebDriverServer
- advanced, super useful, but definitely skippable on a first pass: the json wire protocol
    - http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol

ok, what else? how about: defining some terms:
	- what is selenium?
	- what is selenium python?

explaining the libraries/dependencies:
	- what is pytest?
	- what is unittestzero?
	- what is pytest-mozwebqa?
	- what is bidpom?
